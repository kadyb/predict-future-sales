# Predict Future Sales

The goal of this project is to predict the total amount of products sold in every shop in the future. Time-series dataset containing historical daily sales data was provided by 1C Company, which is one of the largest Russian software firms.
The project carried out exploratory data analysis, advanced feature engineering and developed a predictive model using machine learning methods (i.e. gradient boosting). Finally, an RMSE value of 1.3 was reached on the external test set. The results are completely reproducible including automatic data processing and modeling.
